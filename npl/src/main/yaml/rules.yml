# Party Automation Rules for Commerce System
# Based on schema.org commerce protocols
#
# These rules extract party claims from JWT tokens to automatically
# assign roles in commerce protocols (Product, Offer, Order).

# Product protocol - parties passed explicitly via @parties
commerce.Product: {}

# Offer protocol - parties passed explicitly via @parties
commerce.Offer: {}

# Order protocol - parties passed explicitly via @parties
commerce.Order: {}
